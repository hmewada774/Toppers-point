📌 Where to add images & logos

Place your images in the public/images/ folder as follows:

Site logo: public/images/logo.png
(used in header on all pages)

Toppers photos: public/images/toppers/
e.g. public/images/toppers/raj.jpg, public/images/toppers/riya.jpg (used for static gallery previews)

Event photos: public/images/events/
e.g. public/images/events/annual_day.jpg

Pamphlets / Posters: public/images/pamphlets/
e.g. public/images/pamphlets/pamp1.jpg

Faculty / Classroom photos: public/images/faculty/

When you add toppers via the admin UI, uploaded images will be stored in uploads/ and served at /uploads/<filename>. The backend will save the image path (e.g. /uploads/169xxx.jpg) in the DB and frontend will use that path.
